// Recall how this is used (skip this if you know Haskell's calling patterns):
// - `throttle(100)` is a function that accepts a source callbag.
// - `throttle(100)(source)` is a callbag that throttles the `source` callbag.
// This resulting callbag is ready to be invoked by a sink, that is, a sink will call this callbag with arguments `(0,
// sinksTalkback)`.
const throttle = milliseconds => source => (start, sink) => {
  // If the sink fails to greet us (i.e., fails to meet the callbag spec), bail.
  if (start !== 0) { return; }

  // When we eventually greet the source, we'll get its talkback and put it here. This is the only way we can ask
  // pullable sources to give us more data. (We'll invoke this whether the source is pullable or listenable, but
  // listenables will just ignore it.)

  // If we're dealing with a listenable source, it might produce data faster than the throttled callbag is allowed to
  // send. In that situation, we'll queue up the data here: this is a FIFO (first in first out) queue. If the source is
  // producing slow enough, or if the source is a pullable, this will always be empty.

  // The plan is to set a after every time we send data to the sink; if more data should arrive before the timeout is
  // completed, it's queued. When the timeout expires, it'll (1) ask for more data (which only matters if the source is
  // pullable) and (2) it'll send any data that's been queued up in `stuffListenablesHaveGivenMe`. This is implemented

    // us after the sink has terminated, so no more timeouts.
